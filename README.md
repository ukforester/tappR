# tappR: A Toolset to Estimate Maple Syrup Yields in Southern Sugarbushes

This repository maintains the materials for the R package tappR, which contains functionality to estimate expected maple syrup yields in southern forests based on individual tree characteristics. The equations used to estimate maple syrup yield were built from data collected on 75 sugar maples and 75 red maples in Kentucky across two maple seasons (Hackworth et al. 2024, in press).

The R package is available as a source package (tappR_1.1.0.tar.gz). A user's guide (Supplement 3 of Hackworth et al. 2024) detailing the functionality is also available (Supplement3.pdf).
